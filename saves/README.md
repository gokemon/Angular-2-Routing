A somewhat advanced sample site for Angular routing.
I plan to build out these components

### Description

These are the starter files for the Angular Routing project

### Installation

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
