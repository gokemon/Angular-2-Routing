A somewhat advanced sample site for Angular routing.
I plan to build out these components

as well as these modules

## Gokemon's steps ##
- ***git clone URL***
- ***git checkout -b feature1***
	
	which moved me onto featured branch, is this also consided the "working tree"

	Do some work

- ***git add -A***
- ***git commit -m "comment"***
- ***git status***
- ***git checkout master***
	
	moved me back onto master, 

	getting ready to push to GitHub

- ***git pull***
- ***git merge feature1***
	
	merging my featured branch back into master

- ***git status***
- ***git push***

	inbetween each branch & master merge push, before you jump into another branch, also tag that step

- ***git tag 	-a v1.0.1 	-m "message"***
- ***git push --tags***

### Description

These are the starter files for the Angular Routing project

### Installation

1) Open a command prompt in the project's root directory (APM)

2) Type: `npm install`
    This installs the dependencies as defined in the package.json file.
    
3) Type: `npm start`
    This launches the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to compile the application and wait for changes. 
    It also starts the lite-server and launches the browser to run the application.
